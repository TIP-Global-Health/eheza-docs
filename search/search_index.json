To do this, we verify the problem in one of two ways : By witnessing the issue with our own eyes or through screen shots if the user is remote. By recreating the issue on a separate device to which we have immediate access. Through these methods, most user or device problems will be identifiable - it is helpful to know the list of common user or device problems (see separate list). The second step is to determine the issue\u2019s urgency. An urgent issue interrupts the flow of work at that moment in time or threatens to impact data integrity. Examples: A user CHW cannot access any of his/her patients for a nutrition encounter (this interrupts the workflow - the CHW cannot use E-Heza to do their task). A nurse sees the data from another patient in the record they are viewing (this threatens to impact data integrity). If the issue is urgent, proceed to \u201cReporting and Urgent Issue\u201d If this issue is not urgent, proceed to \u201cCreating a GitHub Issue\u201d Reporting an Urgent Issue To report an issue, contact the dev team on the google chat group. If there is no response after 20 minutes (or a length of time suitable to the situation), contact individual team members via What\u2019s App. You should try to have these things prepare for the chat session: Everything that you gathered to assess the issue (screenshots, the device itself, or a device with which you have recreated the issue) The name of the device with the primary issue (taken from the login screen) Relevant information from the device status screen - a screen shot is best (in the English language view), or otherwise an exact report of any abnormal error messages or statuses. An environment where you can have an extended chat session - if you are not in such an environment, schedule with the dev team a time when you can be. Creating a Github Issue An issue in Github should have the following details (you can copy/paste this list into the issue and fill in the details if it\u2019s convenient): Describe the issue from the user\u2019s perspective, example: At Kibilizi village, while a CHW was conducting a Health Assessment, he wrote the wrong MUAC result. He tried to edit Nutrition measurement/MUAC and add the real number but the system doesn't allow editing the measurement, and after attempting to update, the number remains the same. In this case, he put 8 cm instead of 14 cm when he wants to edit after saving, he clicks on \u201ccompleted\u201d and goes to MUAC, but when he deletes the 8, it keeps showing there. The system allows him to add another number after the 8, but it\u2019s impossible to delete it Provide any details that a developer would need to recreate the issue (this is important because this is the primary way in which a developer troubleshoot the problem). This can include patient information, the device name, and the environment. Example: The name of the child: Etienne N His mother's names: Beatha N Village : Rukura village Device: Rukura Tablet I Environment: LIVE environment Add screenshots where applicable - these can be very helpful in finding the solution.

Database Application data is stored in a database and accessed through Drupal\u2019s database abstraction layer. MySQL, MariaDB, or Percona Server (Recommended) Required MySQL 5.5.3/MariaDB 5.5.20/Percona Server 5.5.8 or higher with InnoDB as the primary storage engine, and requires the PDO database extension. E-Heza itself will generally operate with a default MySQL configuration. In some cases, special configuration may be required for optimization.

Integration with Google Chrome allows users to \u201cinstall\u201d the app to a home screen and delivers a more \u201capp-like\u201d experience to the user. At the application level The app forces an SSL (HTTPS) connection, which encrypts data transfer and protects from third-party (\"man in the middle\") attacks.

The newest version should download automatically - indicated by the status icon at the top right corner of the screen. Yellow means a download is in progress, green means the download is complete. You should visit the deployment status page by tapping on the status indicator. {{< media image_path=\"uploads/deployment-status.jpg\" class=\"half\" >}} There may be a manual step to activate the new app (like shown above) - in this case, tap on the \"Activate New Version\" button. The current version 827d9ba6 should be showing in the top right corner. Reset the environment Because this is a major upgrade, we need to be sure that all data from former versions of the application of the device. We will do this by performing a \"Clear and Reset\" for the URL that serves the application. On an Android device (the directions are slightly different for a desktop, see below): In the chrome browser, go to [the app page at <base domain>/app (do this in the Chrome browser even if you have the app pinned to your homepage on the device).

Pairing a Device Our new application works a little differently in that devices are now paired to the backend. This makes it easy for nurses to log in and out and for devices to switch between sessions. It does, however require that an admin do a little setup work on the device to get it ready for use. {{< notification message=\"You will need an admin (not nurse) password to the backend to perform this step. All admin users and passwords were kept from the previous app version.\" type=\"alert\" >}} To pair a device with the backend, you need to create the \"Device\" on the backend.

You can leave the pairing code blank, as it will be auto-generated.

If you enter a correct pairing code, then the device will start to download data from the backend. We divide the data into two groups. Some data is downloaded to every device, whereas other data is downloaded based on what's needed for the health center that a device wants to work with. (The purpose is to stay within the limits of what can reasonably be stored on the device). Troubleshooting the initial sync You can access the device status page using the icon at the top middle of the screen. {{< media image_path=\"uploads/device-status-icon.jpg\" class=\"half\" >}} In this step, we are concerned only with the data under the Sync Status (General) This is what that section looks like when there is still data left to sync: {{< media image_path=\"uploads/items-remaining.jpg\" class=\"half\" >}} This is what that section looks like when the syncing is complete: {{< media image_path=\"uploads/no-items-remaining.jpg\" class=\"half\" >}} {{< notification message=\"The initial sync on the device can take a very long time (up to 30 minutes with a good internet connection) and it can pause during the process if it encounters problems. This sync only needs to be performed once for a device, but it is important that it is done fully before the device can be used.\" type=\"alert\" >}} There are a few things to note about the initial sync process: A \"sleeping\" device will not sync - during this step the device needs to be attended and kept in awake mode (or the settings should be changed so that it never goes to sleep) The sync can hang at certain intervals. Most of the time the device will recover on it's own after a few minutes of idleness - in fact, we haven't had a case yet, where it doesn't recover. We've seen cases where it sits idle for up to 10 minutes. There are two things you can do to manually recover the sync process: - refresh the app screen (pull down the page for a refresh) - completely exit the app (be sure that it is closed) and open it up again You should only attempt to log in (in the next step) to a device that is fully synced. Logging on to the Device A couple of notes about login and logout. Login is no longer depend on being connected to the Internet. You can login and logout while offline. You no longer enter a username and password. Instead, each nurse is given a 4 digit pin. Pin Codes There is now a \"Nurse\" content type on the backend. All the \"users\" in the former setup have been converted to \"Nurse\" and given a random PIN code. So, you can look it up in the backend at the base domain. For now, that would be by clicking on the \"Content\" menu, filtering for \"Nurse\", and either clicking on an existing entry, or creating a new one. All current nurses and each new nurse added to the system must be given their unique pin code in order to login to the tablet. {{< notification message=\" Note about PIN codes: Nurse PINs and Device PINs are different things - Nurse PINs are used to identify the person who is using the device. It is used every time a nurse accesses the app. Device PINs are used to pair a device with the backend - it is only used once when a device is initially synced and must be reset when a device needs to be paired again.\" type=\"alert\" >}} Main Menu Screen On the main menu screen after logging in, you have the following options: \"Logout\" would log you out. \"Select your clinic\" would launch you into the familiar previous UI for selecting a clinic. However, we'll need to go to the \"Device Status\" page first (the first time). \"Device status\" shows us the status of our contact with the backend. Which health centers are we working with? How recently did we contact the backend? How much data needs to be downloaded? How much data needs to be uploaded? Device Status (Setting up a Device to work with Health Centers) We need to start with \"Device Status\" now, because we need to specify which health centers this device will work with. Here's what you'll see at the moment. From this page you should select the Health Centers that you want synced to this device - you can choose as many as you want, but there is a risk that you will run out of space if you load too many. Working with a session We can now go back to the main page, and then choose the \"Select your Group\" option. Note that groups are enabled or disabled depending on the user you are logged in as. At the moment, you edit these permissions by editing the \"Nurse\" entry on the backend. (And then reloading the browser to sync the changes to the client, or just waiting for the next automatic sync). A couple of notes about this. In the past, we only showed a session here if there was one active right now. What this screen does instead is show recent and upcoming sessions -- any session that is active now, ended less than a week ago, or will start in less than a week. In the past, we could only interact with one session at a time. That is no longer the case -- technically, we can interact with any \"open\" session now. For open sessions, you can now click on the \"Attendance\" button, and you'll get to the familiar \"attendance\" screen. Click on the check-boxes to mark mothers as present (just like you used to), and then click on the icons at the top to start entering measurements etc., just like you used to. The big difference is that the things you enter are being periodically synced to the backend. In the past, we only saved things to the backend at the end, when you \"uploaded\" the session. There is now no separate \"upload\" step -- things are being continuously uploaded periodically as you work. There is also no \"download\" step. You used to have to specifically download a session in order to work with it offline. Now, downloading happens periodically. Now, before you set out to a remote area that has no Internet connectivity, you still might want to check the \"Device Status\" page to make sure that your device is up-to-date, of course. And, once you return, you might want to glance at the \"Device Status\" page to see whether your work has been uploaded. But, it happens automatically. To end a session, there is still an \"End Session\" button: {{< media image_path=\"uploads/end-session.png\" class=\"half\" >}} Which, when you click it, shows this: {{< media image_path=\"uploads/end-session-confirmation.png\" class=\"half\" >}} If you click on \"Continue\" (to close the session), then you get taken back to the clinic page, which now shows the session as being closed: And, of course, that data is automatically uploaded to the backend.","title":"Upgrade to Offline Sync App Version"},{"location":"developer_docs/upgrade-offline-sync/#download-the-app-and-prepare-your-environment","text":"","title":"Download the App and Prepare Your Environment"},{"location":"developer_docs/upgrade-offline-sync/#download-the-app","text":"The first step is to download the new app from site.

Complete with early childhood development (ECD), nutrition, and immunization tracking, SPV helps ensure that young children are on track in all aspects of development. There are 6 main activities in the SPV module: Danger Signs, Nutrition Assessment, Immunizations, ECD, medication, and photo. Danger Signs is comprised of two sub-activities: symptom review and vitals. This sub-activity is used to immediately identify if there are any acute or more pressing illnesses with the child before continuing with the exam. {{< media image_path=\"uploads/spv-symprevie.png\" >}} Nutrition Assessment is comprised of five sub-activities: height, head circumference, MUAC, nutrition, and weight. These combine to alert the Nurse if a child is malnourished or shows signs of macro/microcephaly. If a child does show signs of malnutrition, a nurse will then be able to recommend the child to the correct nutrition program - which is also tracked in E-Heza. {{< media image_path=\"uploads/spv-nutriasses.png\" >}} Immunizations tracks that a child is up to date with all of their required immunizations. Children in Rwanda, as of Fall 2021, receive the following immunizations: Oral Polio Vaccine, Inactivated Polio Vaccine, DTP-HepB-Hib, PCV 13, Rotarix, Measles-Rubella, and HPV (only for girls at age 12). {{< media image_path=\"uploads/spv-immunizations.png\" >}} ECD tracks key developmental milestones over the first 5 years of life. Examples include: turning from their tummy to their back and making consonant sounds to playing make-believe as they are older. {{< media image_path=\"uploads/spv-ecd.png\" >}} Medication is used to ensure that children are getting the appropriate doses of Vitamin A, Mebendazole, and Albendazole depending on their age. {{< media image_path=\"uploads/spv-medication.png\" >}} Photo is used to track the growth of a child.
